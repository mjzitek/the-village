- limits
	- housing
	- food
	- jobs

- people can move in / leave
- people can be "born"
- people can die

- track people's life?  born to death?
	- age?
	- probably too hard for large population so will need some sort of algorithm to simulate
		- averages

- jobs
	- how many people are hunters, soilders, miners, etc
	- job categories

- would be great to track individuals but would probably be too difficult/resource intensive for large popluations
  (see comment above)
